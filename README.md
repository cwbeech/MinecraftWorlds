# MinecraftWorlds
This repository serves as a library of all the minigames* I have created/worked on during my time as a Teacher's Assistant at "Summer at Barstow". Below I'll provide a breif description of each minigame and the extent of my contributions. I worked on these during my downtime while performing my expected duties as a TA. All of the minecraft code I wrote in order to create these games was self taught via google and YouTube.

*Minigame: A minor or incidental game within a larger video game.


Author's Note: If you are unfamilier with Minecraft's in-game code system: command blocks act as Minecraft's cmd interface. In Minecraft "code" and "commands" are synonymous.

Boatyo Drift
  I rewrote all the command blocks and simplified the "Game Start" process.

Guard the Button Tournament
  I created the game from the ground up and programmed each command block. I did recieve some cosmetic help designing the arena thanks to a fellow TA.

Hide and Seek
  I rewrote all the command blocks and simplified the "Game Start" process.

Leaf Run
  I created this game from the ground up building off the foundation that I designed in "Spleef".

Mining Challenge
  I created this Daily Challenge from the ground up. This world does serve a different purpose than the minigames by acting as a "Daily challenge" that would be played for a whole class period.

Snowball Fight
  I built this game from the ground up using another TA's concept.

Spleef
  I created this game from the ground up.

Team Fight
  I created this game from the ground up with the help of another TA. Their help was integral to the wiring/sequencing while I focused on the command block logic and player team selection system.

Tnt Run
  I created this game from the ground up.
